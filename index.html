	<h1> Marine Biology: Pacific ocean activity quiz </h1>
   <p id="p1"> 1. What makes up the Hawaiian Ridge? </p>
   <p id="p1a" class="answer"> A long chain of undersea volcanoes, signifying the presence of meeting tectonic plates. </p>
   <p id="p2"> 2. What caused the bend between the the volcanoes of the Emperor Seamounts and the Hawaiian ridge?</p>
   <p id="p2a" class="answer"> The ridge curved when the Pacific Plate shifted and changed direction. </p>
   <p id="p3"> 3. What is a hot spot?</p>
   <p id="p3a" class="answer">A hot spot is a location with high volcanic activity, where hot magma is forced up out of the mantle, cooling to form undersea mounds or islands. </p>
   <p id="p4"> 4. Where are hot spots that produce single islands or island groups?   </p>
   <p id="p4a" class="answer">Hot spots associated with ocean ridges create singular islands or island groups because they do not move like plates do, hence not making long chains of islands. </p>
